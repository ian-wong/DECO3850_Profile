                        everyday life” where specifically for Foodatory is “Learning Through Play”. Foodatory aims to be
                        a solution to two issues. First, it aims to provide its users with a novel experience that will
                        spark an interest in cooking in the user themselves. Secondly, Foodatory reinforces core
                        concepts of food safety by providing the user with guidance should they do something 'unsafe'.

                    <p class="content-text">Foodatory is a collection of highly interactive mini-games designed to
                        introduce basic cooking skills and the concept of food safety in a fun, safe and educational
                        way. These games involve some of the core physical motions used in cooking such as stirring,
                        spreading and cutting to create a gigantic pizza. It is a game where ideally up to 4 people can
                        play together but more people are allowed to join in to collaborate. The games revolve around a
                        selection of 'smart' kitchen utensils, each of which are capable of providing a variety of
                        feedback to the user in order to help them smarter and safer decisions. For example, the
                        Foodatory Knife can tell if the user is touching the blade of the knife - and will alert them to
                        this fact.

                                their the importance of hygiene and cleaniness. </p>

                            <p>After washing their hands, the users will work together to roll out the 'dough' of the
                                pizza. </p>

                            <p>Followed by another round of washing their hands again, the users will be then divided
                                into two sub stations - the cutting and stirring station.</p>

                            <p>The cutting station will focus on cutting up all the topping ingredients. The available
                                ingredients to cut are salami, mushroom, tomato, pineapple, cheese and olives.</p>

                            <p>The stirring station will focus on creating the sauce for the pizza with the 3 choices -
                                Pizza sauce, BBQ sauce or Cheese sauce. After selecting the sauce, the user will have to
                                stir the sauce ingredients together.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>When the sauce is ready, the stirring team will spread the sauce over the dough using the
                                ladle, followed by the cutting team laying out the toppings</p>

            <p class="content-text">Overall, Foodatory's final outcome was a huge success when it was presented in the
                exhibit at The Edge. We were surprised by the amount of users who enjoyed it, as both aspect of novelty
                and food safety were aimed at a much younger audience so we initially thought that it would not be as
                successful. During the exhibit, the team introduced Foodatory and explained each different station to
                create a fun, collaborative experience. To simulate the hand washing interaction, the team used a gel
                hand sanitiser instead as a sink could not be retrieved for the exhibit. Also, there was a number of
                occassions where there were issues with the capacitive touch sensor in the dough. The sensor was not
                able to detech the capacitive touch through the ladle which led to the sauce not projecting onto the
                pizza. To counteract the issue, we faked the dough technology to a certain degree, by touching the
                capacitive touch pins directly when the user spread the sauce.
