                        implemented throughout the development of Foodatory. Since this project had no clear
                        requirements at the beginning, enforcing an iterative process that can adapt to rapidly changing
                        requirements is key because frequent cycles allowed the team to check and refine
                        against the user's expectations of the experience. Each design cycle had 4 key phases: Research,
                        Analyse, Design, Prototype, Test. </p>

                        Intially, we wanted to focus on the technical aspects of cooking where practicing knife skills,
                        fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination using high technological kitchen tools were used. We
                        researched into the background of understanding why many young adults did not know how to cook
                        and survive into adulthood without any culinary skills. The one major concern we had was that it
                        did not create a playful interactions rather it was a boring training mechanism which did not
                        fit the studio theme of designing playful, open-ended interactions.

                    <p class="content-text">
                        After pitching the concept to the class and we received valuable feedback that our concept
                        should focus on the novelty aspect of cooking and target a much younger audience to enhance the
                        joyful experience. From there we decided to change our concept focusing on the novelty and fun
                        aspect to the game and removed the technical aspect.

                    <p class="content-text">Following on from changing the concept, the team shifted the research to
                        focus on healthy eating and cooking for children and how relying on convenient meals can have a
                        huge impact on their health. Subsequently, the team focused on the interactions at each
                        different station and how the concept can be organised together into a fun experience. Vertical
                        prototyping was used to create a basic prototype for all the interactions so that we could have
                        a sense of how the concept would be interacted. While Ali was in charge of the ladle, I focused
                        on the knife where I separately coded the vibration, sound, lights and touch sensor first,
                        before joining everything together. The initial prototype of the form of the knife was created
                        out of cardboard to get sense of the size and motion of cutting.

                        constraints. The knife had been enlarged and made out of moldable
                        poly-doh to create it out of a stronger material. The spoon of the ladle was also created out of
                        poly-doh. Due to time constraints, a sink basin could not be created so the physical
                        construction was ruled out.
