                        The construction and the technology of the knife was the most significant contribution to the
                        project. I researched and asked the tutors how to implement each interaction before I dived into
                        coding. First, I worked on the technology
                        side by implementing the capacitive touch, vibration, sound, and then the Neopixels separately.
                        After understanding the different
                        technologies, I combined it together and made sure that it was working.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        Following the coding part of the knife, I used the initial prototype (Cardboard Knife) created
                        by Claire and Jai as a guideline to create the form of the knife. I decided to create the whole
                        knife out of moldable play-doh and first created 3 different cardboard cutouts varying in sizes.
                        The blade was created using two rolled out sheets of moldable play-doh that was stuck together
                        to create a hollow center for any wires that would be needed to thread through. The handle was
                        created by dying the play-doh gray while it was still soft and malleable then wrapped around a
                        rolling pin to create a cylinder shape whilst it was drying.

                        the dough needed eight different sensors one for every slice so that the sauce can be projected
                        onto each slice.

                Overall, I feel I had consistently contributed towards the project throughout the whole semester. I was
                able to learn Arduino which I definitely wanted to learn at the beginning of the semester and enjoy
                working with a team that I have never worked with. To be able to see the outcome of the work that I put
                in, I feel very happy with the whole project. However, there were at times where the workload was uneven
                between the members especially for the prototype where Ali and I did most of the work.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                In terms of the contribution for my work, looking back there are some improvements that I would make
                reduce my delivery time for the knife. During the construction of the handle for the knife, I took too
                much time redesigning and remaking it because sometimes it was not wide enough to fit the wires and then
                it was not long enough to fit everything inside so I always had to melt the poly-doh down and construct
                it again. Next time, I would definitely measure out everything before and then I'll start the
                construction. Another issue that I had trouble with was soldering the connection and wires together, I
                was very inexperienced and novice when it came to soldering and it took many attempts to get it correct
                but now I do have more confidence in understanding how to solder and knowing the importance of the
                errors that can be made.
